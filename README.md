## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive form validation messages if:
  - Any field is missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - The avatar upload is too big or the wrong image format
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, form field hints, and error messages announced on their screen reader
- See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form

## My process

### Built with

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For type safety
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got to keep learning about svelte and its components, and how to use them in a project, combining them with SASS for styling, and TypeScript for type safety. 
I also got to learn about the accessibility features of svelte, and how to use them to make the project more accessible.

### Continued development

I plan to keep trying frameworks other than React, like this project where I use svelte, trying new style libraries for styling like tailwindCSS and work on full-stack projects to get more experience with backend development.
